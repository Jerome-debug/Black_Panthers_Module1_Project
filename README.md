# Black Panthers Module 1 Group Project

In this project we analyze Gender Equality in the Olympic Games held over the years.
We used Python language for the analysis and used tableau for vizualization

**Business Success criteria**
We are going to analyze the female participation in different sports in the Olympics. 
Greater gender equality (measured using the Gender Inequality Index) is associated with higher participation and medal counts in the Olympic Games from 1996 through the years.

We have two datasets available for this project showing  Olympic games over the years.

* athlete_events.csv - This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016
* noc_regions.csv -This dataset shows the Regions and their NOC(A National Olympic Committee (NOC) is a national constituent of the worldwide Olympic movement.

**Data Insights**

- The more participants a country has going to the Olympics(on average) the more medals they can expect to win at the games 
- The country with the tallest competitor on record was china with the shortest coming from Bangladesh
- An above average height and weight for participants has a positive correlation with winning more medals with Gold winners having the highest values for all medal winners
- Basketball, volleyball, water polo have the highest average heights of participants with Gymnastic, Trampolining and diving having the lowest average heights 
- The oldest participants were mostly playing Roque(bougie croquet) at ~53 years, while the youngest were in rhythmic gymnastics at ~18 years
- The heaviest participants were in Tug-of-War, Bobsleigh & Basketball, with the featherweights in Rhythmic Gymnastics, Synchronized swimming & Gymnastics


**Conclusions**

- The number of athletes, events, and nations has grown dramatically since 1896, but growth leveled off around 2000 for the Summer Games.
- Geographic representation in the Games has grown since 1896, although Africa, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and South America are still very under-represented.
- Female participation increased dramatically, and this trend started during the Cold War.
- The size of Olympians have become more extreme over time. In most sports this means taller and heavier, but in a few sports such as gymnastics, athletes have become smaller.
- More sporting activities have been added to the Olympics over the years.
